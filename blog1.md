But what really went wrong? As an aspiring developer in CyberSecurity developer, or Computer Science / Engineering Undergrad studying Operating System as subject(course work), or a Windows driver developer, what are the things that we can learn from this and how should one take this Case Study as reference for future engineering POV? That's what we are discussing here!
